# Eight Ball API
This is a simple web app that uses  [next-tailwind-api-template](https://github.com/jacobschwantes/next-tailwind-api-template) as a base to create a simple API with documentation for getting magic-eight-ball responses.

It uses [sentiment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment) to analyze positive/negative sentiment to determine a biased response.

# Features

- Random readings
- Biased readings using basic sentiment analysis
